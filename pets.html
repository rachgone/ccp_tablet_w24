            <img src="images/lilo_dog1.JPG" width="200" alt="Black and White American Pit Bull Terrier"><br>

            <p> Lilo is a 1-year-old American Pit Bull Terrier. She prefers to spend her days lounging among the three
                different beds/couches that her family has gifted her. She enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood,
                as long as she can pretend that she doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of
                not wanting to admit she has no real courage to chase them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Lilo suddenly wants to release all her energy.
                She will place her toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving her toys "a ride."
                There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

            <img src="images/lexi_dog3.jpg" width="200" alt="Orange and White Mudhol Hound">

            <p> Lexi is a 6 year old Mudhol Hound, and she's quite the girl. She's got this beautiful orange coat
                and
                eyes that just seem to understand everything. Lexi moves with this smooth agility, making her a
                perfect
                example of what a Mudhol Hound should be quick and graceful.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>But beyond her looks, Lexi's got a heart of gold. She's not just a great athlete; she's like one of
                the
                family. Lexi's got this incredible sense of smell, and she's always ready for some fun. She's just a
                normal, lovable dog, but there's something special about the way she carries herself a mix of
                elegance
                and charm.</p>
